**M**y name is Lapacazo M. Sandoval and I am a storyteller.  My C.V. details my extensive background as a unit \[film\] publicist (IASTSE LOCAL 600) and my current work as an entertainment journalist covering film, film festivals, and big ticket events like the Tony Awards, SAG Awards and The Oscars.

**T**hat's one side. [@lapacazo][0]

**T**o be honest, I don't dig staying in one labeled box or another too long; I am jumpy much like a comical flea; wearing a shiny silver top hat and coal black tails keeping up appearances on the center stage known as life.

**I** am not ashamed to admit that I recently learned the difference between listening and hearing.

**S**omewhere between actually breathing, letting go and forgiving myself, I begun to listen to the stories that surround my world and as such, I've begun my own "walk about" --- engaging all types of creative people and scratching at what makes them tick.

**B**ut let me walk backward again and share that, as a storyteller, I am developing three multi-media children stories that all focus on ordinary characters that gain magical powers which help them learn creative ways of dealing with the big, bad bullies that plague their lives.

**T**he first is The SleepyTown Collection which is about a bully free, magical world where all kids are loved equally, and animals pretty much run the magical joint.

**T**he second multi-media children property is BOOGALOO.  Hold on to your hats, this adventure is about a feisty, dance-crazed fairy that's being chased by a handsome, rap obsessed and spoiled pre-tween prince and his  immortal side-kick D.J. Badger.

**T**he third is Lady, The Smiling Pitbull which is a modern, urban fairytale set to music which follows the magical, mis-adventures of Lady, a baby pitbull who just wants to be "pretty" and her two best-friend ---Booger and Snot --- fat cats--- who gain powerful magic and then get lost in NYC.

**A**ll three of the multi-media children properties are in various stages of development and are registered.  For more information on the projects please email me and I can connect you with my legal and business team: lapacazo.sandoval@gmail.com

**B**elow are a few links to my writing and I will update weekly.
