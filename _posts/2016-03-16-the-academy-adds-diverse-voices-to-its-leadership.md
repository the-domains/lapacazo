**THE ACADEMY ADDS DIVERSE VOICES TO ITS LEADERSHIP**

**_Reginald Hudlin, Effie T. Brown, Stephanie Allain_**

At the 2016 Governors Ball preview, I shared with Dawn Hudson, Chief Executive Officer of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, that if it weren't for Academy President Cheryl Boone Isaacs, I would not have a career in film, which began, for me, as a unit publicist; a rare opportunity for people of color especially in the early 90's. 

In looking over the names of the three new governors joining the Academy's 51-seat Board ---which include 

**Reginald Hudlin**

(Directors Branch), 

**Gregory Nava**

(Writers Branch) and 

**Jennifer Yuh Nelson**

(Short Films and Feature Animation Branch)--- I realized I've been following and admiring their work for many years. 

The bare bone facts at the core of "inclusion" is serious business, especially in the trillion dollar film industry because it impacts on the economic health of communities that have been marginalized and ignored for far too long. The Old Guard of Hollywood only valued our rich and diverse communities for the money that filled their "war chest" but made breaking in and getting rich, in show business, a closed door affair.

That was then and the "now" is changing for the better.

"I'm proud of the steps we have taken to increase diversity," said Boone Isaacs. "However, we know there is more to do as we move forward to make this a more inclusive organization."

  
In reviewing the other additions, the Board also appointed additional Academy members to each of the six Board committees that provide oversight to specific Academy areas. 

•

Actor 

**Gael García Bernal**

joins the Awards and Events Committee, chaired by First Vice President Jeffrey Kurland.

•

Cinematographer 

**Amy Vincent**

joins the Preservation and History Committee, chaired by Vice President John Bailey.

•

Producer 

**Effie Brown**

joins the Museum Committee, chaired by Vice President Kathleen Kennedy.

•

Executive 

**Marcus Hu**

and Animator 

**Floyd Norman**

join the Education and Outreach Committee, chaired by Vice President Bill Kroyer.

•

Executive 

**Vanessa Morrison**

joins the Finance Committee, chaired by Treasurer Jim Gianopulos.

•

Producer 

**Stephanie Allain**

joins the Membership and Administration Committee, chaired by Secretary Phil Robinson.

To keep the positive momentum flowing, the Board also reaffirmed its January 21 resolution to make sure Academy voters are active in the motion picture industry. In the meeting, the Board decided that each branch executive committee will determine specific criteria for active voters based on the guidelines established in January.  Active voters are defined as:

•

those who have worked in the motion picture industry in the last 10 years;

•

those who have worked anytime during three 10-year periods whether consecutive or not;

•

members who have won or been nominated for an Oscar

.

The branch executive committees will meet every two years---starting this spring---to review their members and determine any potential reclassifications. The committees also will adopt an appeals process for members who may lose their voting privileges.
